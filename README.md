# named-routes-express

WIP, not quite finished.

Allows 'naming' routes to allow reverse lookups. This lets you decouple the functionality from
the URL scheme. Inspired by [express-named-routes](https://github.com/RGBboy/express-named-routes), with a better syntax.

### Usage

#### Install
`npm install named-routes-express`

#### Use
```js
//todo. hah.
```
